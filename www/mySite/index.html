      <h2>Free Agency Roundup: Markieff Morris staying with Lakers</h2>
      <h5>The veteran says he is ready to "run it back" with L.A. in its quest for a second straight NBA title, Dec 7, 2017</h5>
      <div class="image"><img src="image/markieff-morris-isos.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: 300px;"></div>
      <p>Markieff Morris says he will be back for another go around with the Lakers in 2020-21.
        <br><br>
        Morris took to Twitter on Monday, writing "Run it back! #Lakeshow". He was a key reserve on L.A.'s championship squad from 2019-20, acquired for the stretch run on Feb. 23 after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. Morris appeared in 14 regular-season games (averaging 5.3 points and 3.2 rebounds) and 21 playoff games (5.9 ppg, 3.0 rpg), providing rebounding and scoring punch for the Lakers.
        <br><br>
        Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Morris' deal is for one year at the league minimum.</p>

      <h2>Brooklyn's Kevin Durant sees action for 1st time in 552 days</h2>
      <h5>Kevin Durant finally suits up for the Nets following his lengthy recovery from a torn Achilles tendon, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <div class="image"><img src="image/durant-pullup-scaled.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: 300px;"></div>
      <p>The former Kia NBA MVP and four-time scoring champion suited up Sunday for his “new” team, the Brooklyn Nets, whom he joined via sign-and-trade all the way back in July 2019, mere weeks after tearing his Achilles tendon with the Golden State Warriors in Game 5 of The Finals.
        <br><br>
        The catastrophic injury forced Durant sit out the entire 2019-20 season, lengthy hiatus and all. In addition to his monstrous salary, it was a price the Nets were more than willing to pay in order to land a player with the sixth highest scoring average in NBA history at 27.02 points per game.
        <br><br>
        “It felt great to be back in the routine and be back on the floor and feel like a player again,” Durant said. “It felt great. Everybody’s texting and calling and asking me how I’m feeling. I can’t wait until that’s over with so I can get back in the swing of things and just feel like one of the guys again.”
